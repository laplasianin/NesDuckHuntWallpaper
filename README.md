This is a simple wallpaper inspired by legendary NES game Duck Hunt.

Was developed as example project for fun few years ago.

It's animated wallpaper (dog is walkink and sniffing around, ducks are flying and falling sometimes, dog jumping to the grass, catching it and showing it like in game).

This source code was tested on Android 2.3 many years and I am not sure if it is compiling and linking.

So the first TODO is check if it is working
