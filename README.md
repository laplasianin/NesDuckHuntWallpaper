This is a simple live wallpaper inspired by legendary NES game Duck Hunt.

Was developed as example project for fun few years ago.

It's live wallpaper and has two modes (configuring in settings): 
- Wallpaper mode. Hound is walkink and sniffing around, ducks are flying. Dog sometimes jumping to the grass but appears sad with no ducks
- Game mode. Interactive mode with touch support. You can kill innocent duck by yout own finger. Duck will fall into the grass, Dog will jump to it and appears with 1 or 2 ducks (if you shoot the second too). Then new ducks appear and it loops again...

This source code was tested on Android 2.3 many years ago and I am not sure if it is compiling and linking now. (APK attached to repository works correctly on my android 4.4 THL 5000)

So the first TODO is check if it is compiling
